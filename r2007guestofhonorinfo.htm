<p><font size="3">The ACSAA Board of Directors and the Reunion 2007 Organizing
Committee are&nbsp; pleased to announce that the Reunion 2007 Guests of Honor
will be &quot;<b>Sra&quot; Herminia Granitto, &quot;Profe&quot; Donato Luis
Laurita, Iris Lestani, and Raymond McKay</b>. &quot;<b>Sra&quot; Granitto and
&quot;Profe&quot; Laurita</b> are legacies at Lincoln School, having each
devoted almost 50 years of service to Ward/AGHS and Lincoln Schools as Physical
Education instructors. Given they are both approaching their mid 80’s, this
may be one of the last opportunities for the ACSAA to invite them to a reunion. <b>Iris
Lestani</b> dedicated over 39 years of her career to Lincoln School as an
administrative secretary and for the last 25 years has been our ACSAA liaison
person with Lincoln School. The annual ACSAA Scholarship is named after Iris.&nbsp;<b>
Raymond McKay</b> is our newest Guest of Honor. Ray joined the Lincoln School
faculty in 1979 and has held positions of teacher, Guidance Office Director,
Dean of Lincoln University College since 1992, and in 1998 added the title of
Director of National Programs and Services. He was the Sponsor for the Class of
1981.</font></p>
