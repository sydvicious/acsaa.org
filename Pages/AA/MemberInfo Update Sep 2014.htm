For the last number of years the payment of dues has been suspended because the
ACSAA has not been issuing the Gaucho Gazette newsletter
publications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ACSAA has been in transition to move
information to the Internet because of the labor intensive efforts in the past
to mail out publications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLEASE DO NOT MAIL IN DUES
CHECKS.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Board of Directors will be evaluating how to best
communicate with alumni in the future,&nbsp; given the prevalence of social
networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who were current on their dues for the last
newsletter from @ 2010 will retain a credit for the time remaining in their
membership term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New membership criteria will be posted once
the publications issues are resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font><p><b><font size="4">The
