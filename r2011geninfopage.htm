<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Reunion 2011 was a tremendous success and
attendance was beyond our most optimistic projections.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Organizing Committee's original estimate was in the range of 200+ alumni
including family members.&nbsp; Actual attendance was close to 700 alumni and
family at the three events including the anniversary reception,&nbsp; banquet
and asado.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of late requests to attend the reunion had
to be turned away because of space limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>

in the planning,&nbsp; with particular mention of the individuals
