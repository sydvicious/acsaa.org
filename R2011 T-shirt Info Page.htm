<p>Dear Alumni,&nbsp; Faculty and Friends,&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i><b>The ACS Alumni Association&nbsp; is pleased to pass on that T-Shirts,&nbsp;
sweatshirts and polo shirts may still be available in certain styles and sizes for orders mailed to addresses
within the United States</b></i>.&nbsp; Ben &quot;Lanny&quot; Smith '63 had
again come through for Reunion 2011 with merchandise at very reasonable prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
has been our reunion T-shirt supplier for over 15 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The beautiful logo design uses the La Lucila mansion (part of the school campus
since the early 1950's)&nbsp; as the main theme &nbsp; <b>You have the option on
the T-shirts to select&nbsp; a design with or without the Tango Dancers.
&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the past,&nbsp; a portion of the net
sales income from the Reunion 2011 related sales will be donated to benefit the
ACSAA Scholarship Fund.&nbsp; Due to local government and school
restrictions,&nbsp; merchandise sales were not possible at the reunion on school
grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
