<p><font size="3">By Raymond McKay, Dean, Lincoln University College and written
several days after Dr. Mittelman's death. </font></p>
</font>
<p><font size="3">&quot;<i>In Memoriam</i></font></p>
<p><i><font size="3">A TEACHER CALLED &quot;DOC&quot;</font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="3">Who was your all-time best teacher? Hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of former Lincoln students would unhesitatingly answer
&quot;Doc.&quot; His full name was Dr. Naum Mittelman, but for them the full
name is no more necessary than is the full name of Mozart or Maradona. He is
just &quot;Doc,&quot; the teacher who for four decades in his classroom and
laboratory on the third floor of the Lincoln Mansion seduced students with the
delicious uncertainties of modern science and other passions of the intellect.
&quot;Don't flirt with knowledge,&quot; he liked to say. &quot;Fall in love with
it.&quot;</font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="3">Doc turned his intense attention from research to teaching
after completing a post-doctoral stint at Harvard and working with Argentina's
Nobel-Prize winning chemist Luis Leloir for two years. For the next half century
Doc professed passionately, first in the University of Buenos Aires, then in
Lincoln High School, and for the last two years of his career, in Lincoln
University College.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="3">Doc's primordial proposition became, in effect, &quot;I
teach therefore I am.&quot; Like Kurowawa's teacher in &quot;Madadayo,&quot; he
was abetted in his stubborn resistance to retirement by admiring and fiercely
loyal students. Before finally retiring from Lincoln High in 1995 at the age of
82, he taught chemistry for a time from his hospital bed. One student would go
to the hospital and receive the lesson and then transmit it to his classmates.
In 1997, when continuing heart problems were forcing his retirement from
part-time teaching at Lincoln University College, Doc gave impromptu lessons in
chemistry to the doctors who attended him in the hospital. Struggling to recover
sufficiently to convince his family to let him teach one last course at LUC, he
made his case to continue clearly and simply &quot;If I am not teaching, I am
not myself.&quot;</font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="3">He was not able to teach that last course, but he continued
to teach those who called him, wrote him, or visited him. One of the last visits
was from a young man who had studied chemistry both in the High School and at
LUC with Doc and who went to get a final lesson before following the path of the
young Naum Mittelman to advanced studies at Harvard.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font size="3">Teacher and chemist to the end, Doc never allowed his ideas
to become inert. They never will be. Doc passed away on Good Friday here in
Buenos Aires, but his ideas will live on and flourish in his students and their
progeny throughout the world.</font></i></p>
