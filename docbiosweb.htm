<p class="MsoNormal">Äfter graduating from the Colegio Nacional de Buenos
Aires, Dr. Mittelman studied at the University of Buenos Aires where he earned
his Ph.D in Chemistry.&nbsp; After completing his doctorate, his first
professional job was at the Virus Section of the Instituto de Microbiología&nbsp;
headed by a scientist of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research.&nbsp;
Two years later, Argentine Nobel&nbsp; Prize winner, Dr. Bernardo Houssay, who
was at that time the President of the Asociación para el Progreso de las
Ciencias, awarded Doc a scholarship to study at the Physical Chemistry
Department of Harvard's Medical School, where he worked two years.&nbsp; Upon
his return to Argentina, he started working for the Instituto de Investigaciones
Bioquímicas directed by Dr. Federico Leloir, who later became a Nobel Prize
winner.&nbsp; After two years he &quot;had the courage to teach!&quot;, as he
told us once.&nbsp; He taught at the University of Buenos Aires, at the
Engineering School of the Escuela Superior Técnica del Ejército (this
prestigious institution has always had outstanding, well known professors among
its staff), and at Lincoln .&nbsp; Many of his students had mentioned that when
they started their college studies, they were one year ahead in Physics and
Chemistry, thanks to Doc.&quot;</p>
