<p>The ACSAA regrets to pass on the sad news that &quot;Doc&quot; Mittelman died
of heart failure in Buenos Aires on Friday March 29th. He was 88. Dr. Mittelman
joined the Lincoln School faculty in 1955 and taught Physics and Chemistry for
almost four decades until his retirement in 1995. He later continued to teach
part time at Lincoln University College until 1997. &quot;Doc&quot; touched the
lives of several generations of students, leaving them well prepared for future
careers. He was a Guest of Honor of the ACSAA at Reunion 1987 in Cocoa Beach, FL
and will be missed as a most beloved teacher and mentor. He is survived by his
wife and two daughters.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%">Arrangements have been made with Lincoln School for
those that wish to make a donation to help the Mittelman family and/or send
cards of condolence or tributes in his memory. Checks can be made out to <b>Asociacion
Escuelas Lincoln </b>and marked<b> &quot;Familia Mittelman&quot; </b>in the Memo
Section. The school will turn over any donations to the Mittelman family and
will collect written tributes in a binder to present as a memorial gift. Because
of uncertainties with mail delivery in Argentina we suggest those who wish to
communicate by regular mail should send cards and letters to</p>
